## ðŸ’œ About this project

I love cooking, and I've gathered all my favorite recipes in one spot. Just so you know, they're all vegan.

## ðŸ“¯ Technologies

I'm gradually getting into <strong>Next.js</strong>, so I'm using it for this project. Over time, I'll be adding more features to get a better grasp of the fundamental concepts of Next.js, like data fetching, routing, rendering, and more.
